# defaults file for slack-notification
# Updated to use non-inline
#
# Make sure that when you call the role that you override at least the slack_message
# Example use:
#     - include_role:
#     name: slack-msg
#     vars:
#       slack_message: "Processing host {{inventory_hostname}}"
#       slack_channel: "{{ slack_test_channel }}"
#This should be over written when the role is called
slack_message: "Hello from {{inventory_hostname}}"
#
# default slack_icon: "https://www.ansible.com/favicon.ico"
# This one is a cool wolf face.
